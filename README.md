## Overview of the Challenge
PlanMyTrip is collecting customer data to survey their vacation preferences so as to provide better hotel choices. After showing various relationships between latitude and (max temp, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed), it is time to create a beta app to help narrow customers' hotel choices down. The goal is to retrieve destinations, hotels nearby, and the weather condition for customers based on their minimum and maximum temperature thresholds. Lastly, create a potential itinerary with directions between cities for customers. 

## Results
